# Principal-Component-Analysis Overview

Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces the amount of information needed to store a dataset. It is a dimensionality reduction technique to improve runtime on the dataset when applying large computations such as classifiers to them. To do this, PCA identifies the primary direction of variation and which features vary together or separately.


# Main Features

- Can be used with any numeric datasets, including image datasets
- Determine the primary, secondary, etc direction of variation
- Evaluate which principle components vary together
- Examine the efficacy of data reduction


# Execute

- Download and run .zip file or View jupyter notebooks in Github
- For best results, run or view notebooks in order:
